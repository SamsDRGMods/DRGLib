# RefreshGameBindings

| Function name | RefreshGameBindings |

| Function Library | Content/DRGLib/InputFunctions/LIB_F_Input |

Forces the game to refresh all input bindings. Anytime "Force rebuild keymaps" is used then you need to refresh the game mappings

**Note:** this node accomplishes it's goal by creating and closing an options menu widget. This probably has side effects, but whatever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
